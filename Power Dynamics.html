        <p>
            We believe that every organization has power dynamics.
            We are committed to being fully transparent about our organization's power dynamics.
            
            Below is a description of Blue Shark Friend's power dynamics.  
            You are free to choose to use this.  You are free to create your own.  
            But if you choose to adhere to the Shiver Methodology, be fully transparent about your community's power dynamics.

        <h1>
            Our rule regarding power dynamics

        <h2>
            Rule 1
        </h2>

            If someone has discretionary power over another person's housing, employment,

            in the Blue Shark Friends community.

        </h2>

            Those associated with the community are always free to leave without consequence to their relationships with others in the community.
