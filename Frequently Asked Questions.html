            Why Shiver?
        </h2>
             <p1>
                A shiver is a collection of sharks.  A gaggle of geese.  A murder of crows.  A shiver of sharks.  As Blue Shark Friends, when we collaborate, we form shivers.

                A shiver is also a shaking, a vibration, an autonomic response that helps remove fear and cold from the body.
                
                In water, vibrations create ripples.  Water molecules bump into each other and pass the energy along.  Ripples become waves.  Waves become tsunamis.  Change happens when we vibe with our communities.

        <h2>
            What is a Shiver Community?
        </h2>
            <p2>
                A shiver is a community of economically interdependent business owners, freelancers, and individuals who choose to collaborate using a shared digital platform.

                Shiver is also the name of our open-source website-creation software.

                Further, Shiver stands for Shiver Holistically Inspires Virtual and Economic Reparations.  Shiver is a methodology of digital community organizing that prioritizes holistic interactions between independent community crewmates and voluntary redistribution of wealth and labor for the benefit and support of the community.

            What is a Shiver Venture?
        </h2>
            <p3>
                A shiver venture is a joint venture created by members in the community of economically interdependent business owners, freelancers, and individuals.

         <h2>
            Who are crewmates?
        </h2>
            <p4>
                Crewmates are verified (properly IDed) individuals who have existing personal relationships with the members of the shiver and are provided access to a private virtual space that acts as a community center.       
            </p4>
         <h2>
            What does it mean for a business to be para-capitali
        </h2>
            <p5>
                We do not engage in the trading of percentage stake in our business for anything other than labor.

                We do not employ.  All who work with us are either part of our business, own their own businesses, or are freelance independent contractors.
                
                We cannot avoid existing in capitalism but the communities we build are not dependent upon it.           
            </p5>
        <h2>
            What does it mean for a business to be labor-first?
        </h2>
            <p6>
                We do not raise capital.  
                When we see a need, we purchase services.  
                If we cannot purchase services, we partner.

                If the person we have chosen to partner with cannot provide services because of their financial instability, we promote that person's story and raise funds to cover that person's <a href= "https://bluesharkfriends.com/needs">needs</a>.                
            </p6>
        <h2>
            What does it mean for a business to be disabled-first?
        </h2>
            <p7>
                We accommodate disabled people before we accommodate able-bodied people.  We choose community over efficiency.  We move at the speed of trust.
